{"name":"HIVBackCalc: ","tagline":"A New Method for Estimating the Number of Undiagnosed HIV Infected Based on HIV Testing History","body":"### Welcome to the HIVBackCalc website\r\nThis site hosts the resources available to researchers and public health staff who want to use HIV testing history data to estimate undiagnosed HIV. The basis is a statistical \"back-calculation\" model that incorporates the testing data along with HIV diagnoses to estimate backwards in time from diagnosis to incidence. The intervening period defines the undiagnosed time. The model is implemented in the statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) through the [HIVBackCalc package](https://github.com/hivbackcalc/package1.0/wiki), hosted on [GitHub](http://www.github.com). \r\n\r\n### Understand how it works\r\nRead about the methodology in the [PLoS One paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129551). For a less technical overview, check out [this presentation](https://github.com/netterie/HIVBackCalc_App/blob/master/supporting_docs/Estimating%20the%20Undiagnosed%20Fraction.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Try the app\r\nWe've used [RShiny](http://http://shiny.rstudio.com/) to create [a browser-based interface for HIVBackCalc](https://hivbackcalc.shinyapps.io/HIVBackCalc_App). Try it out on the embedded sample testing history data, or upload your own testing histories. Concerned about data privacy? Follow the steps outlined in the [app tutorial](https://rawgit.com/netterie/HIVBackCalc_App/master/Instruction%20Manual/Instruction_Manual_2.html) to load the app locally and run the model from your own computer rather than from the web. **Coming soon:** users with testing history data stored in eHARS will be able to easily extract the relevant variables and enter them directly into the app.\r\n\r\n### Join our beta-testers\r\nWe're partnering with public health departments to pilot the app and produce local undiagnosed estimates. Join our beta-testers to get estimates for your vicinity and provide feedback as to how we can improve the user experience and make the method more relevant to local populations. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble or have any questions?
